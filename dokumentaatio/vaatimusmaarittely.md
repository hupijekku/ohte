### Product Scope  
Procedural World Generator (PWG) is a Java11/JFX desktop application for procedurally generating
different types of worlds, maps and dungeons. Main use cases of the application include, but are not
limited to, creating maps for game development, creating battle maps for tabletop role-playing games
(such as D&D) and learning about different procedural generation methods.  

### Basic Functionality  
- User can select the type of world to be generated (i.e. World/Terrain/Dungeon)  
- User can choose from different procedural generation methods for the selected world type  
- User can tweak variables associated with the chosen method  
- User can view the generated map (Simplified JFX drawing?)  
- User can save the map locally (Xml/Database?)  

### Further development   
- Exporting the map as Xml-document  
- Exporting the map as .png image  
- Importing previously PWG-generated Xml maps  
- Uploading spritesheets for map preview?
